Checkmate changelog
===================

Version 0.3.0
-------------

To be released.

### Frontend

 -  `checkmate github` command became to leave no comment when there are
    nothing to `CHECK` corresponding to the given diff.  It also removes
    the existing comment previously left by Checkmate on the same pull request.

 -  Added `checkmate github-travis` command, a shortcut command of
    `checkmate github` for Travis CI integration.

### Internals

 -  Added `Checkmate.Publisher` and `Checkmate.Publisher.GitHub` module.


Version 0.2.1
-------------

Released on September 26, 2017.

 -  Fixed a parser bug which had scanned continuous inline comments of
    unmatched styles, e.g.:

        // CHECK This line is scanned.
        // This line also is scanned.
        -- This line had been scanned, but the parser is fixed
        -- so that it isn't scanned anymore.

 -  GitHub Flavored Markdown renderer (`checkmate gfm` and
    `Checkmate.Rendrer.toGFMarkdown`) became to ignore soft linebreaks to be
    consistent with CommonMark renderer.


Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on September 25, 2017.

 -  Now `CHECK` comments in source codes can be multiline.  The following
    patterns are supported:

     -  ~~~ c
        /*
        CHECK Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, per facilis reprimique ut,
        ei agam invenire mel.

        Tacimates nominati vix ut, ea iudicabit prodesset deseruisse duo.
        */
        ~~~

     -  ~~~ c
        // CHECK Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, per facilis reprimique ut,
        // ei agam invenire mel.
        //
        // Tacimates nominati vix ut, ea iudicabit prodesset deseruisse duo.
        ~~~

 -  `CHECK` keywords with a colon (i.e. `CHECK:`) became matched.
